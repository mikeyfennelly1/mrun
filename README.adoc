== Overview

mrun (**_m_**ike's **_run_**time) is a low level, OCI compliant container runtime written in Go. It contains a package that you can download for interacting with the cgroup filesystem interface, documentation about container technology, a command line to use the tool and _more to come_...

[NOTE]
====
This runtime is created to be compatible with Linux operating systems that have systemd as the init system. I did not create this runtime to be reliable/platform independant. Do not rely on this runtime.

=== Original Goals of this project

Originally this project was created as a way to learn Linux and container technology. It ended up requiring a lot of research, hence the long pauses in development during the period of creating mrun.
