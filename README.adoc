= mrun (Mike's runtime)

mrun is a low level container runtime written in Go, with CLI capabilities. It is compliant with the OCI spec for container runtimes. The version of the OCI spec is yet to be decided.

== Install

You can go to the versions/release page (here), and choose which binary suits your setup.

== Inspiration

_TL;DR: This is inspired by runc/crun._

The inspiration came from reading into modern container tools (Podman/Docker/Kubernetes), and seeing that they all rely on container runtimes. Due to this topic being primitive to many cloud tools I thought it would be worthwhile and interesting to learn how the fundamentals work - this is an exercise in doing that. I am getting quite interested in this stuff, so I am using this as a method of getting hands-on with this sort of stuff.

== Goal

To create an OCI compatible runtime that can be used in Kubernetes environments as a primary environment (only in demo - do not use this in production).
