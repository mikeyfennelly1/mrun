= Errors and Logging with the mrun runtime

mrun provides command line options to enable desired log levels. This can help a user understand what is occurring under the hood, and do what they will with that information.

== Enabling log levels

mrun provides the 7 standard log levels:

1. *Trace*: Provides detailed information about how mrun created the container.

2. *Debug*: Provides debugging information.

3. *Info*: General operational entries about what is going on in the application.

4. *Warn*: Something unexpected happened, but mrun is still running fine.

5. *Error*: Serious issues.

6. *Fatal*: A very serious error occurred, causing application to exit.

7. *Panic*: Logs a message and triggers a runtime panic.

The standard, out of the box logging level is _Fatal_.
