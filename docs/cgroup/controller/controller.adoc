= controller

A controller is an interface to control a resource. These controllers can be used to control resources for that cgroups processes such as:

1. memory
2. pid
3. cpu
4. cpuset
5. io _(block I/O)_
6. net_cls _(network packet class)_
7. net_prio _(network priority for outbound traffic)_
8. rdma
9. devices

These controllers are divided into sub-controllers. These sub-controllers manipulate parts of the controller, for example the memory sub-controller `memory.high` defines a high end limit to the memory that is available to the processes in the control group, and to child control groups of the control group.
